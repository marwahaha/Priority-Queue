# Priority Queue
### To Run:
- Navigate to the directory where the files are kept.
- Enter the command 'make'.
- To preform a heap sort, enter './priority heapsort' followed by the numbers you wish to sort.
- Make sure they're seperated by spaces!     
> ./priority heapsort 10 9 5 7 8 20
- To enter into a priority queue, enter './priority priority' followed by the numbers you wish to have as keys.
- Again, make sure they're seperated by spaces!     
> ./priority priority 10 9 5 7 8 20
- An onscreen menu should appear and guide you through the operations you can preform. 
- Elements are generated randomly and are dealt with automatically as they're seen as strictly arbitrary.
